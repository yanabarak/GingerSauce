      <p>
        The brand archetype is the character of a brand: a live representation that is created
        taking into consideration all the nuances of the target audience and the brandâ€™s concept. A
        character that the audience can relate to. Once the archetype is defined, you will now know
        how people will see, and comprehend the brand. You will know what the brand will sound,
        look, and behave in certain situations. You will understand its values, and views on life.
        Knowing an archetype allows you to create a full-fledged personality, and structure further
        brand strategy.
